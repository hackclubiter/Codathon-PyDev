# Day 03

Hey everyone!!!
Yesterday we completed conditional statements and looping. So today lets dive deeper into python programming language ... ðŸš€

Today we are gonna cover 4 data types i.e. Lists, Tuples, Sets and Dictionaries.

<hr>

First let's have a look into Lists. 

    List is a collection which is ordered and changeable(modifiable). Allows duplicate members.

1) [Lists](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list/#ae)
  
    a) Operations
    
    - [Creating](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list/#cl)
    - [Size](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list/#ksl)
    - [Adding Element](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list/#ael)
    - [Accessing Element](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list/#ael)
    - [Removing Element](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list/#rel)
    - [Sort List](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_sort.asp)
    
    b) [List comprehension](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list/#lc)

    c) [List slicing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list/#sl)

    d) [More list methods](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-list/#lm)
    
You can refer to the video lecture for Lists [here](https://youtu.be/W8KRzm-HUcc)

<hr>

Now we move onto Tuples.

    Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable or unmodifiable(immutable). Allows duplicate members.

2) [Tuples](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp)

    a) [Access tuples](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples_access.asp)

    b) [Update tuples](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples_update.asp)

    c) [Unpack tuples](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples_unpack.asp)

    d) [Join tuples](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples_join.asp)

    e) Methods

    - [count()](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/tuple/count)
    - [index()](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/tuple/index)

You can refer to the video lecture for Tuples [here](https://youtu.be/W8KRzm-HUcc)

<hr>

Now we cover Dictionaries

    Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable(modifiable) and indexed. No duplicate members.

3) [Dictionary](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp)

    a) [Access items](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries_access.asp)
    
    b) [Change items](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries_change.asp)
    
    C) [Add items](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries_add.asp)
    
    d) [Remove items](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries_remove.asp)
    
    e) [Loop dictioanries](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries_loop.asp)
     
    f) [Copy dictioanries](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries_copy.asp)
    
    g) [Nested dictioanries](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries_nested.asp)
    
    h) [Dictioanry Methods](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries_methods.asp)
    
    - [clear()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_clear.asp)
    - [copy()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_copy.asp)
    - [fromkeys()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_fromkeys.asp)
    - [get()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_get.asp)
    - [items()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_items.asp)
    - [keys()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_keys.asp)
    - [pop()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_pop.asp)
    - [popitem()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_popitem.asp)
    - [setdefault()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_setdefault.asp)
    - [update()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_update.asp)
    - [values()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_values.asp)

You can refer to the video lecture for Dictionaries [here](https://youtu.be/daefaLgNkw0)

Now the last data type for today i.e. Sets

    Set is a collection which is unordered, un-indexed and unmodifiable, but we can add new items to the set. 
    Duplicate members are not allowed.

4) [Sets](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sets-in-python/)

    a) [Access  items](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets_access.asp)
    
    b) [Add items](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets_add.asp) 
    
    c) [Remove items](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets_remove.asp)
    
    d) [Loop sets](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets_loop.asp)
    
    e) [Join sets](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets_join.asp)
    
    f) [Set methods](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets_methods.asp)
    
    - [add()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_set_add.asp)

    - [intersection()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_set_intersection.asp)
    - [intersection_update()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_set_intersection_update.asp)
    - [isdisjoint()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_set_isdisjoint.asp)
    - [issubset()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_set_issubset.asp)
    - [issuperset()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_set_issuperset.asp)
    - [pop()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_set_pop.asp)
    - [remove()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_set_remove.asp)

<hr>

Now if you have completed the abover portion then you are more than capable of solving some problems on these topicsðŸ”¥
So now lets have a some practice on these data types.

- [Lists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_lists1)
- [Tuples](https://www.w3schools.com/python/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_tuples1)
- [Dictionaries](https://www.w3schools.com/python/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_dictionaries1)
- [Sets](https://www.w3schools.com/python/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_sets1)

Now with this we have reached the end of Day 03 of 7 Days of Python Development. Tomorrow we'll dive deeper into Python. 

Till then .... Keep learning, Keep inovating âœ¨âœ¨
