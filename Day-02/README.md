## Day 02
*Hello Everyone! Hope you have done with Day 01 and learnt the basics. Now, let's move to some more basic topics and get acquainted with the syntax of python.*

### But before moving to our topic, lets first understand the term "indentation" and why it is important in Python
- Python indentation is an important concept to know even before you get started with coding in Python. This is because if you are not aware of how to indent a Python code, then you will end up seeing indentation errors and your code will not get compiled. So quickly go through this article to know Python indentation and its importance.
- **What is Python Indentation:**
Compilers/interpreters generally do not know the sequence in which they need to execute the statements in a piece of code. Hence, to make it easier, we divide the code into several blocks of code and indent it. This indentation helps them understand the order in which each block/statement should be executed.
- In simple, all the statements with the same distance (space) to the right, belong to the same block. In other words, statements belonging to a block will necessarily start from the same vertical line. You can imagine it this way.

**Note that you must understand this term because if you make a silly mistake and miss a single indentation then you will get errors**

**Okay, now we can move to today's topics which are**
  - Conditional Statements
  - Loopings

## Conditional Statements
So, till now I can expect that you have understood what *conditional statements* are! So, let's now understand the syntax of Python's conditional statements.

In Python, we don't have much but the listed below are very important:
  - [If-else](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp):
    - [if statement](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-if-else/?ref=lbp#if)
    - [if..else statements](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-if-else/?ref=lbp#if-else)
    - [nested if statements](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-if-else/?ref=lbp#nif)
    - [if-elif ladder](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-if-else/?ref=lbp#if-elif)
    - [Short Hand if statement](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-if-else/?ref=lbp#short-if)
    - [Short Hand if-else statement](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-if-else/?ref=lbp#short-if-else)
  
  Here's a video which may help you to understand better. - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp5MuPOtsSY)
  
So, this was till Python version 3.8 but in 3.9 we are now having switch case in Python. Yes, we didn't have switch case in Python like other languages. But now we have. But still, we don't use switch more as compared to if-else.
Just for a knowledge, give a read about switch cases in Python. - [**LEARN ABOUT SWITCH CASES** - Video](https://youtu.be/q4pnb5aDXXQ?t=270)

Okay, that's all about the conditional statements in Python!

## Loopings
Loopings are very important in all programming languages because this is the reason why computers are made for. Now, loop plays a very important role and understanding it is very much important. Almost every Data Structure revolves around looping, so read about it thoroughly.

We have two looping types
1. [For Loop](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-for-loop) 
2. [While Loop](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-while-loop)

For better understanding, you may refer [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dN4Cn4u2M0) or give it a try at [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp)

Okay, we are keeping it less and we want you to have a thorough practice in looping. There are several tricks and you will learn it by yourself thorugh practicing.

<hr>

Since we covered the basics of conditionals and looping, now practice some problems to check your understanding.
1. [If else elif](https://www.w3schools.com/python/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_ifelse1)
2. [For loop](https://www.w3schools.com/python/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_for_loops1)
3. [While loop](https://www.w3schools.com/python/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_while_loops1)

<hr>

We hope that you have now cleared your basics and understood the basics syntax, operators, conditional statements and looping. Tomorrow, we will move to a complete new topic so stay tuned for that.
