**BONUS**:

**Which IDE to choose?**

> Many students ask which IDE to choose for Python**

> Tbh, there are many IDEs for Python like PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code. But If you will ask me, then I will prefer VS Code over others because VS Code has lot of functionalities and it is easier to use.

### Now you have selected your IDE, lets move to the coding part...

*Before we plunge into the vast and unending world of Python let's know how to print our first "Hello World" program in Python.*

> Open your IDE or Terminal

> First type `python` to check if Python is there or not. (I hope you have done this part in your Day-00)

> Now if you have done this now let's print the `Hello World` in Python.

```python
>>> print("Hello World")
Hello World
```

*It is very important to brush up the basics in every language to know the syntax of every language.*
**Go through the resources listed below and be confident with the basics**
