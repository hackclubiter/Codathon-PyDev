## About
Welcome to this 7 days of Python Development!üëã

It is an initiative for people to learn how to learn python, irrespective of their current level of expertise. ‚úå 

The main objective behind this program is to provide you with access to top-notch content at zero cost. ‚ú®

It'll be a week long intensive and hardcore learning marathon. 

We have designed beginner-friendly lessons covering the Python. The topics have been distributed over the course of 6 days. 

And then for the last and final day of this event, all the participants will have to submit a project which they must make within that week only. No previously prepared project will be accepted. 

Furthermore, there are quizzes to be conducted at the end of each day to help you sharpen your basics in a fun and riveting way. üíõ

So see you at the end of this week. üëç
