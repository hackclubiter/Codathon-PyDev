> Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. [Read More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))

## Why Python?
> Now you might be suddenly bogged with the question, why Python?
> Its a cool language if you want to learn just for fun or if you want to build your career around
Python, you will adore the language. With new technologies taking the market by surprise Python
has been playing a dominant role. Whether it is cloud platform, mobile app development,
BigData, IoT with Raspberry Pi, or the new Blockchain technology, Python is being seen as
a niche language platform to develop and deliver a scalable and robust applications.

## Some Key Features of Python
> - Python programs can run on any platform, you can carry code created in Windows machine and run it on Mac or Linux.
> - Python has inbuilt large library with prebuilt and portable functionality, also known as the standard library.
> - Python is an expressive language.
> - Python is free and open source.
> - [Very Important] Python can be both dynamically and strongly typed--dynamically typed means it is a type of variable that is interpreted at runtime, which means, in Python, there is no need to define the type (int or float) of the variable


# Installation
> Here we will look forward to the installation of Python on three different OS platforms, namely, Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.

Windows | Mac | Linux

### Note for Linux
These days most of the Linux-based systems come preloaded with Python, so in most cases, you do not need to install it separately. However, if you do not find your desired version of Python on the Linux platform, you can download your desired version for a particular Linux platform from the site [https://www.python.org/downloads/source/](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/).
> Perform the following steps:
> > 1. Extract the compressed file using the tar -xvzf python_versionx.x command.
> > 2. Browse the directory of the compressed file as shown in the screenshot:

> > 3. Run the following commands:
```bash
          [root@localhost Python-3.8.11]# ./configure
          [root@localhost Python-3.8.11]# make
          [root@localhost Python-3.8.11]# make install
```
> > 4. Now you are done.
